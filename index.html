			<p>Based in New York, Dennis Clemente thinks he's had enough of cold winters. So he got himself in a flexible bootcamp program on Full Stack Web Development at UC Berkeley to see if he can really make the transition from Web Production to Web Development and settle in sunny California.</p>

			<p>What is Web Production, exactly?</p>

			<p>Coming from a journalism background, Dennis refers to it simply as the merging of editorial and marketing of websites. He blogs for and about companies and makes sure that the content entries rank high on Google (read: they're SEO or search engine optimized content), using his nose for good stories and hooks as editor and writer.</p>

			<p>There is some technical work involved but since the sites are run on Wordpress sites, he makes sure articles and photos are uploaded, keywords and tags are added, descriptions are clear, and photos are also included. He makes use of plug-ins that help the sites get the eyeballs they need. For good measure, he uses analytics to track their performances.</p>

			<p>In between projects, Dennis has also been known to write for US-based publications while also serving as Freelance Copywriter and SEO specialist for ad agencies and startups. </p>

			<p>He has worked with such clients as Citibank, Coke, Courvoisier, DISH, Foxwoods, Loweâ€™s Home Improvement, MassMutual, SK-II, Vonage and Western Union in their traditional and digital marketing efforts.</p>
